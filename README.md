# Chess

A Python-based Chess GUI and Engine developed as a final project for CS40S. This project allows users to play Chess against a computer, which utilizes the minimax algorithm to get the best move. The GUI is built using the pygame library in python.

## Getting Started

To run Chess on your local machine, ensure you have Python installed. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the main Python file to start the game.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentAndrew810/sudoku.git
cd sudoku
python main.py
```
